# Contributing to Omni-Scanner

Thank you for considering contributing to **Omni-Scanner**!  
We are excited to work with developers who are passionate about network scanning tools and open-source collaboration.

Please **read this guide carefully before raising an issue or opening a pull request (PR).**  
Following these steps ensures smooth communication and faster merging.

## Reporting Bugs

- Use **GitHub Issues** to report bugs.
- **Use the provided Issue template** and include:
  - Steps to reproduce the problem
  - Expected behavior
  - Actual behavior
  - Screenshots or logs, if possible
- Be clear and specific. This saves everyone's time.

## Feature Requests

At this moment, **new feature requests are not being accepted**.  
We are focusing on stabilizing the existing functionality.

(You can still suggest small improvements through Issues, but major features will not be entertained.)

## Pull Request (PR) Process

- **Test the project manually** on your machine before submitting a PR.
- Create a **new branch** for your contribution:
  - `feature/<short-description>` for new code
  - `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes
- Always **pull the latest changes** from the main branch before starting.
- Your PR should have a clear title and meaningful description.
- Keep PRs focused — **do not combine unrelated changes.**

## Coding Style

- Follow standard **Python (PEP8)** style guidelines as much as possible.
- Variable and function naming: **be consistent** and **descriptive**.
- Comment your code when necessary to make it understandable.

## Testing

- We currently **rely on manual testing**.
- Please verify your changes thoroughly on different platforms if possible (Windows, Linux).

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful, warm, and open-minded.
- Criticize code, not people.
- Disagreements are natural — communicate professionally.
- No spamming, trolling, or toxic behavior will be tolerated.

## Review Process

- Pull requests will be reviewed by the project maintainer(s).
- Feedback may be provided — be ready to refine your PR if required.
