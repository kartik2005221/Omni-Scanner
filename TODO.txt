TODO-6: Sanitize input before using in subprocess.run
    Potential Security Risk with subprocess.run:
    Using subprocess.run with user inputs directly can be a security risk (command injection). It is better to sanitize
    and validate inputs before using them in subprocess calls.
    For example, if the user input is used directly in the command, an attacker can inject additional commands
TODO-8: add csv and moving them to back up functionality on next run
todo-9: adding extra functionalities like,
    scapy>=2.5.0          # For ARP scanning and packet manipulation
    python-nmap>=0.7.1    # Nmap integration (requires nmap installed)
    prettytable>=3.6.0    # Clean terminal output formatting
    colorama>=0.4.6       # Cross-platform colored terminal text
    tqdm>=4.64.1          # Progress bars for long scans
    manuf>=1.1.5          # MAC address vendor lookup

Extra functionalities:
- arguments mode development
- add a section in readme for preparing user's os to run this script**
- update documentation**
after doing **, pull to the main branch

--disable-arp-ping, -Pn, (-a) not with the script
-o-all, -oX, -oG
