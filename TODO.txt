TODO-6: Sanitise input before using in subprocess.run
  Potential Security Risk with subprocess.run:
  Using subprocess.run with user inputs directly can be a security risk (command injection). It is better to sanitize
  and validate inputs before using them in subprocess calls.
  For example, if the user input is used directly in the command, an attacker can inject additional commands
