You’ve actually got two near‑identical menu engines—one for Linux and one for Windows—and a slew of shared helpers under `utils/`. Before you deep‑dive into any one file, I’d recommend a quick, high‑level refactor plan so you don’t just solve the same problems twice:

---

## 1. **Unify Your Menu Logic**

### What’s happening

* Both `menu_linux()` and `menu_windows()` loop over almost the same options, differing only in platform‑specific commands or flags.
* You duplicate `level_1…4` in both OS modules with tiny tweaks.

### Why it matters

* Every time you want to tweak the main menu layout or add a “\[S] Switch to SUDO” option, you’ll have to edit both files.
* Bugfixes or new features (like a “Save output in XML”) will need copy‑paste work.

### How to improve

1. **Extract a generic `menu()`** in `utils/menu_engine.py` that takes a list of `(label, handler_fn, is_available_fn)` tuples.
2. For Linux vs Windows differences, pass in a small “strategy” object or closure that wraps the platform‑specific command builders.
3. Keep only the truly OS‑specific code in `OS_scripts/linux.py` and `windows.py`—everything else goes into common modules.

---

## 2. **Centralize Command Building**

### What’s happening

* You build your ping, traceroute, and nmap command lists inline in the menu levels.
* Helpers like `_append_to_list_ping` live in different files with different signatures.

### Why it matters

* If you later decide to add a `--timeout` flag to every scan, you’ll end up editing four functions plus two OS modules.
* Tests become a nightmare when your logic sits inside loops and input calls.

### How to improve

1. Create a new module, e.g. `utils/scan_builders.py`, with pure functions like:

   ```python
   def build_ping_cmd(target: str, count: int, flood: bool=False) -> List[str]:
       # builds and returns the list of args
   ```
2. In your menu code, simply call the builder, then handed the result to `run_command_save()` or `insert_spinner()`.
3. Now you can write unit tests for every `build_*_cmd` function without touching I/O.

---

## 3. **Layer Your Application**

* **Presentation**: your interactive menu or a CLI framework (Typer/Click/argparse).
* **Application Logic**: “I want to run ping with these options” (your builders).
* **Execution & Persistence**: `run_command_save()`, JSON logging, scans folder.

By clearly separating these three layers, you’ll dramatically reduce duplication and make each piece far easier to test and extend.

---

## 4. **Adopt a CLI Framework for Scripting**

You already maintain a fancy interactive mode—but power users (and CI) crave non‑interactive, scriptable commands:

```bash
$ omni-scanner ping --count 20 --timeout 2 10.0.0.1
$ omni-scanner arp --fast
$ omni-scanner nmap --os-detect --ports 80-100
```

A framework like Typer gives you:

* Automatic `--help` docs.
* Option parsing and validation (e.g. check `--ports` format for you).
* Easy binding between your builders and presentation.

Your current menu becomes just one “interactive” subcommand instead of the heart of the app.

---

## 5. **Next Steps for You**

1. **Sketch your new module boundaries** on paper (or in a whiteboard app):

    * `scan_builders.py`
    * `menu_engine.py`
    * `cli.py` (Typer entrypoint)
    * `executor.py` (wraps `subprocess` and JSON logging)
2. **Port one feature**—e.g. the ping submenu—into this new structure. Write a unit test for your `build_ping_cmd`.
3. **Replace the interactive menu** with a Typer CLI that calls your refactored ping code.
4. **Iterate**: once ping is clean, move traceroute, nmap, and finally ARP.

---

### Remember

> **You’re not just rewiring code—you’re building maintainable patterns.**
> With every refactor, ask: *“Will adding one more scan type or OS flag still be easy, a month from now?”*
> That mindset—over chasing a quick fix—will turn Omni‑Scanner into a tool you’ll actually love to grow.

Take one bite at a time. Start by centralizing that ping logic, write a couple of tests, then expand. Keep me posted on your first refactor and we’ll tackle the next challenge together!
